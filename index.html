      <p>
        I am a software developer with approximately four years of experience in backend development, primarily using Java and related technologies. My journey began with a strong academic foundation, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Universidade Paulista. Throughout my studies, I actively participated in algorithm competitions and technology fairs, which helped solidify my logical reasoning and passion for solving complex problems through code.
      </p>

      <p>
        To deepen my knowledge and keep pace with evolving technology, I am currently pursuing a postgraduate MBA in Software Development. This program allows me to explore advanced concepts in system architecture, modern development methodologies, and cloud technologies, further enhancing my ability to design scalable and efficient software solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I have worked on several enterprise systems, with experience in microservices, RESTful APIs, and relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. At RDL Digitais, I was responsible for backend development, focusing on data processing and system integration. Later, I joined Virtues Medias & Apps, where I progressed from a Junior Java Systems Analyst to a Mid-Level Java Developer, contributing to the architecture and optimization of core systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold certifications that validate my technical background, including the Oracle Certified Associate in Java and the Microsoft MTA in Software Development Fundamentals. These certifications reflect not only my technical proficiency but also my ongoing commitment to professional growth and excellence.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am deeply motivated by clean code, scalable design, and innovative thinking. I believe in continuous improvement and in using modern tools such as Docker, Jenkins, Git, and cloud platforms like Azure and AWS to deliver high-quality software. My professional path is guided by a desire to learn, collaborate, and create solutions that have real-world impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a little about my professional journey so far — a combination of education, hands-on experience, and an enduring drive to grow as a developer. I am excited about the future and ready for the next challenge.
