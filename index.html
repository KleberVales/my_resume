  <p>
    I am a Software Engineer with over five years of experience in backend development, specializing in Java and the Spring Framework. My professional journey is built on a strong academic foundation, holding a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Universidade Paulista, where I developed solid analytical skills and a deep interest in solving complex problems through software.
  </p>

  <p>
    To continuously evolve and stay aligned with modern software engineering practices, I am currently pursuing an MBA in Web Software Development. This postgraduate program allows me to deepen my knowledge in software architecture, distributed systems, cloud-native applications, and modern development methodologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout my career, I have worked on enterprise-level systems using microservices architecture, RESTful APIs, and relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. I have experience designing, developing, and maintaining scalable backend services, always focusing on clean code, performance, and maintainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    My professional growth includes hands-on experience with DevOps practices and cloud environments. I actively work with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes, as well as cloud platforms such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Azure. These skills allow me to contribute beyond development, participating in deployment strategies, automation, and system reliability.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold multiple certifications that reinforce my technical expertise, including Oracle Certified Associate – Java SE, Scrum Fundamentals Certified, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2025 certifications in DevOps and Generative AI. I also explore Generative AI as a productivity and automation tool, applying it to software development workflows and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am driven by clean architecture, scalable design, and continuous improvement. I value collaboration, technical excellence, and delivering solutions that create real business impact. My goal is to keep evolving as a Software Engineer, contributing to robust systems and preparing for senior and architectural roles in modern, cloud-oriented environments.
